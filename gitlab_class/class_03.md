# Simple queries

## Conditions
```sql
SELECT title, rating, length
FROM film
WHERE length > 100;
```
```sql
SELECT title, `length` FROM film
WHERE `length` BETWEEN 100 AND 120;
```

## Mutilple Tables
```sql
SELECT city, district
FROM address, city
WHERE address.city_id = city.city_id;
```

## Adding distinct
```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] country, city
FROM address, city, country
WHERE address.city_id = city.city_id
AND city.country_id = country.country_id;
```

## Conditions with columns in different tables 
```sql
SELECT title, name
FROM film, `language`
WHERE film.language_id = language.language_id
AND film.`length` > 100 AND language.name = 'English'
```

## Ambigous column names
```sql
SELECT title, category_id
 FROM film, film_category, category
WHERE film.film_id = film_category.film_id 
  AND film_category.category_id = category.category_id
``` 

## Adding Order BY
```sql
SELECT title, special_features, rental_rate, name
 FROM film, film_category, category
WHERE film.film_id = film_category.film_id 
  AND film_category.category_id = category.category_id
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC
```
### More than one column
```sql
SELECT title, special_features, rental_rate, name
 FROM film, film_category, category
WHERE film.film_id = film_category.film_id 
  AND film_category.category_id = category.category_id
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC, special_features ASC
```
## Using Limit

| %        | Allows you to match any string of any length (including zero length) |
| _        | Allows you to match on a single character                            |

```sql
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE special_features LIKE '%Trailers%'
```
When searching for characters _ %, they have to be escaped with \ (default escape character)

```sql
SELECT * FROM address
WHERE address LIKE '%\_%';
```
## Arithmetics
```sql
SELECT title, description, rental_rate * 15 AS "In Pesos"
